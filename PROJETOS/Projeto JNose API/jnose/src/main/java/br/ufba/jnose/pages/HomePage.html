                Here we have the option to pass the address of a local folder and perform a search for test smells. With the following return: Project Name, Test Class, Production Class, LOC, Number of Methods, and the quantity of each of the 21 test_smells found per test class.

                In this option we can pass the end of the "project" folder which will be searched for test smells. With the following return: Project Name, Test Class, Production Class, test smells name, method name, occurrence line, initial occurrence line, final occurrence line.

                Using GIT version control we can perform a search for test smells on each commit performed or tag existing in the project history.
                The return is the same as the ByClassTest, with additional commit information: commit id, name of who committed, commit date and commit message.

                In this option, we can pass the specific file we want to analyze, together (optionally) with your production file, which will be checked for the testsmells in your structure. With the following return: TestSmell Name, Method Name, and Range (Location in the Code where TestSmell is located), and the option to view the code with Smell.
