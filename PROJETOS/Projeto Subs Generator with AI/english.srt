1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,640
 I hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen. But I find the best thing to do with a new employee.

2
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,679
 It's to size them up with a long hard stare.

3
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:18,000
 So, first day. Yes. Scary. Yes. Don't be scared. Well, I'm not pretty scared. You should be. Why am I a little bit scared?

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,640
 What don't be? Make up your mind. So here you are. Yes. I'm really looking forward to getting to grips with this.

5
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,599
 I'm going to put you in IT because you said on your CV you have a lot of experience with computers.

6
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:42,879
 I could say that's on my CV. But a lot of experience with that whole computer, I'm saying emails,

7
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:54,719
 sending emails, receiving emails, deleting emails, I could go on. Do the web using mouse,

8
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:03,359
 nice as using mice, clicking, double clicking, computer screen of course, the keyboard,

9
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,199
 the bit that goes on the floor down there. The hard drive. Correct.

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,879
 Well, you said you seem to know your stuff. I've got a good feeling about you, Jen,

11
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,759
 and they need a new manager. Fantastic. So, the people I'll be working with, what they like.

12
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,759
 Standard nerds!

13
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,119
 Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?

14
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,959
 Okay, well, the button on the side. Is it glowing?

15
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,639
 Yeah, you need to turn it on.

16
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,639
 And the button turns it on?

17
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:35,120
 Yeah. You do know how a button works, don't you? No, not on clothes.

18
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,240
 Hello, IT. Yeah, huh?

19
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,560
 Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?

20
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
 Not, no, there you go. No, there you go. I just heard it come on.

21
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,680
 No, no, that's the music you hear when it comes on. No, that's the music you hear when

22
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,759
 I'm sorry, are you from the past?

23
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,759
 You see, the driver hooks a function by patching the system cool table, so it's not safe to unload it,

24
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,080
 unless another thread's about to jump in there and do it stuff. And you don't want to end up in the

25
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
 middle of invalid memories.

26
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,280
 Hello?

27
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,280
 Oh, really? Reed, well, why don't you come down here and make me then? What? What you think I'm afraid of you?

28
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,879
 I'm not afraid of you. You can come down here anytime, I'll be waiting for you.

29
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,199
 That's all her.

30
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,520
 Oh, God, it's a while time you got back. It's been all go. You had a job.

31
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,280
 Girl on fifth. Did you and her hit it off?

32
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,239
 Define hit it off?

33
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,000
 Did she continue talking to you once you'd fix her computer?

34
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:42,639
 No. And while I was working on it, she rested a cup on my back.

35
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,639
 No, yeah.

36
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,599
 Unbelievable. I mean, they're no respect for us up. They're no respect.

37
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:54,799
 Watch the way for we're all just drudgens to them. Yes. If they're worse such a thing as a drudgen,

38
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:58,559
 that's is what we'd made to them. It's like they're polywally when there's a problem with their

39
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,480
 printer, but once it's fixed, they toss us away like yesterday's jam. Yes, yesterday's jam. That is what we are to then.

40
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,639
 Actually, you know what, that doesn't really work as a thing because you're jam last for ages.

41
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,560
 Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?

42
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,600
 You do six toilets. You have you do six toilets like anemic field.

43
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:37,519
 That's the sort of place this is, Jen. A lot of sexy people not doing much work and having affairs.

44
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,480
 Oh my god, look at that view.

45
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
 I feel like I'm on top of the world.

46
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,519
 Well, Jen, this is where I leave you.

47
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,639
 It's normal, 34.

48
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,360
 30. Okay, where am I going?

49
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,959
 Well, the way down to the basement. Good luck.

50
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,639
 Get out of the left. Get out of the left. Get out of the left.

51
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,879
 Get out of the left. Get out of the left. Get out of the left.

52
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,079
 Get out of the left.

53
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
 Oh, welcome to...

54
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,479
 Oh my god. Oh my god.

55
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
 Oh, oh, look at them.

56
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,159
 Hahaha!

57
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,860
 Hello?

58
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
 Hello.

59
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,639
 LAUGHTER

60
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
 Yes, I believe it was tall-stoy, you said,

61
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
 oh, it seems we have a visitor.

62
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,639
 LAUGHTER

63
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,639
 I'm sorry, my self-enemories were just engaged in quite a serious discussion about books and such.

64
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,639
 We didn't hear you come in.

65
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,639
 What is second? You said it was tall-stoy, you said,

66
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
 what? Oh, I never mind that now, Mordys.

67
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
 When have you read tall-stoy?

68
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,639
 She'll show up, Marles.

69
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
 Why are you speaking that weird voice?

70
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,639
 When did I don't remember this conversation at all?

71
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,639
 You don't know what to say, but you are just one-stoy.

72
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,639
 We silly, you've never talked.

73
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,639
 LAUGHTER

74
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,639
 Many people come down here to visit.

75
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
 What are you talking about? Who comes down? What people?

76
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,639
 Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?

77
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,639
 So, what can we do you for?

78
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,639
 I'm the new head of this department.

79
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,639
 Is this my office?

80
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,639
 Why? What did you say?

81
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,639
 I am the head of this department. I thought I was.

82
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,639
 That's one of us, certainly not her.

83
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,639
 I'm gonna sort this out.

84
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,639
 You've got a headband there. Headband!

85
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,639
 I don't want to be rude or anything,

86
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,639
 but I wasn't informed of any changes to this department.

87
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,639
 Oh, did they not tell you about me?

88
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,639
 No! And we are perfectly fine down here.

89
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,639
 Thank you very much. We're more than capable of taking care of ourselves.

90
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,639
 So, so, you know you're covered in blood.

91
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,639
 Moss!

92
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,639
 That was an interesting idea.

93
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,639
 Aw, wicked! I know what this is. It's the new Harry Potter.

94
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,639
 I got the child edition and the adult edition.

95
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,639
 Just a check that there are no differences in the text.

96
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,639
 Sorry, but I'm not going to be able to deal with that woman.

97
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,639
 If nobody else going to get the 400 floors, I'll get it.

98
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,639
 No, that is not a fool. I'm going to have a little light down.

99
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,639
 Come in.

100
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,639
 Yeah, denim.

101
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,639
 Yeah.

102
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,639
 Yeah.

103
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,639
 No, no, no.

104
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,639
 They've been fine so far.

105
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,639
 Yeah. I think we're going to get on great.

106
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,639
 Yeah, I know.

107
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,639
 All right, then, then you take care.

108
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,639
 All right, yeah, well, yeah.

109
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,639
 Okay, okay, okay, okay.

110
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,639
 Okay, okay, bye, bye.

111
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,639
 So, hello.

112
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,639
 What can I do you for? What can I do for you?

113
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,639
 Hello, I was just wondering,

114
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,639
 do you want me to connect up your phone?

115
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,639
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

116
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,639
 It's working.

117
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,639
 I was just talking to denim, there.

118
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,639
 What do you want to do?

119
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,639
 I'm closing the door for me.

120
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,639
 Oh, yeah, sure.

121
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,639
 Yeah, from the other side.

122
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,639
 Of course.

123
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,639
 Like this.

124
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,639
 That's it.

125
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,639
 With me on the...

126
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,639
 Thanks.

127
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,639
 Oh.

128
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,639
 Are you all right?

129
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,639
 Oh, yes.

130
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,639
 We might have something fine to know.

131
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,639
 I didn't do my sort of an experience.

132
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,639
 I'm standing over here.

133
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,639
 I know. I'm joking. I'm fine.

134
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,639
 What are we going to do about her?

135
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,639
 Well, I just went in and she was having a pretend conversation.

136
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,639
 Really?

137
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,639
 Yes, she's a little bit weird to say the least.

138
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,639
 What's that?

139
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,639
 I'll just water.

140
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,639
 Sometimes I get a hot air and this helps cool it down.

141
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,639
 She is quite to be on bull.

142
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,639
 Did you notice how she didn't even get excited when she told this original ZX81?

143
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,639
 Yeah, not was weird.

144
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,639
 It's almost as if she doesn't know anything about computers.

145
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,639
 What?

146
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,639
 We did.

147
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,639
 I don't worry. That's why I'll always make two cups of tea.

148
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,639
 Anyway, what were we talking about?

149
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
 I'll hurt not knowing anything about computers.

150
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,639
 What?

151
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,639
 Definitely want to get rid of her.

152
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,639
 I agree, yeah.

153
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,639
 Okay.

154
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,639
 So here's the plan.

155
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,639
 A plan.

156
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,639
 Let me put on my slightly larger glasses.

157
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,639
 Okay, hit me.

158
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,639
 Okay, we're going.

159
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,639
 When?

160
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,639
 You know what? I'm going to min it.

161
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,639
 Will that be enough time for me to get to know the plan?

162
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,639
 Yeah, you know what? I shouldn't have used a word plan.

163
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
 I've clearly gotten you over at excites.

164
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,639
 Would scheme be a better word, although that's just as exciting.

165
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,639
 I might even need these.

166
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,639
 All I was going to say was,

167
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,639
 We go in. I make up a load of ball-ups about computers and was easy to pick up on it.

168
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,639
 Yes, so I can say why you didn't want to use a word plan.

169
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,639
 Let me do the talk.

170
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,639
 All right.

171
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,639
 Okay, we need to get this right.

172
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,639
 Yeah.

173
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,639
 We need to stay calm.

174
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,639
 We do not want to go in there half-cocked.

175
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
 Okay.

176
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,639
 I don't go.

177
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,639
 How could I help?

178
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,639
 Well, we were just wondering now that your boss,

179
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
 would you like us to access the Duchess Appliar and connect you up to the matrix?

180
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,639
 You just made all that up.

181
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,639
 You don't know anything about computers and minutes.

182
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,639
 You've stopped trying to undermine me.

183
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,639
 Now get in there and do some work to do with computers.

184
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,639
 Come here, let me have to check up on you.

185
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,639
 Okay, lady. You've won this round.

186
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,639
 But we can wait.

187
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,639
 You will slip up one day and believe you, me.

188
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
 We will be there when you do.

189
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,639
 There will be some piece of evidence that will prove without action.

190
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,639
 I don't know anything about computers.

191
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,639
 What are you doing?

192
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
 Fugging in your computer?

193
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,639
 It might be something you say or something you do.

194
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,639
 But when we do us acess and believe me, we will notice us.

195
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,639
 It's going to be a long way down for you sweet cheeks.

196
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,639
 He'll realize in a second.

197
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,639
 I cannot believe you're going to tell me.

198
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,639
 It's like a pair of horrible old women.

199
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,639
 What did she say?

200
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,639
 She said we're like horrible women.

201
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,639
 She didn't.

202
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,639
 Hey, guys.

203
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
 Hey, it's got to be a tell me.

204
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,639
 Yes, well, it's like this.

205
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,639
 Look at you, my IT team.

206
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
 Team players each and every one of you.

207
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,639
 She has no wrong for people who can't act in a team and my team.

208
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,639
 Excuse me.

209
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,639
 Hello?

210
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,639
 What?

211
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,639
 If you can't look as a team you're all fired.

212
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,639
 That's it you have me fired. Get your things and go.

213
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
 I'll let's security.

214
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
 Everyone on floor four is fired.

215
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,639
 It's got them from the premises.

216
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,639
 And do it as a team.

217
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,639
 Remember your team and if you can't act as a team you're fired too.

218
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,639
 Don.

219
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,639
 Get on to recruitment.

220
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,639
 Get them to look for a security team that can work as a team.

221
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,639
 They may have to escort the current security team from the building for not acting like a team.

222
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,639
 Team.

223
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
 Team, team, team, team, team.

224
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,639
 I even love saying the word team.

225
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,639
 You probably think that's a picture of my family.

226
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,639
 Uh-uh.

227
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,639
 It's the 18.

228
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,639
 Bowling.

229
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,639
 Doyle.

230
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,639
 Tiger.

231
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,639
 The jewelry map.

232
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,639
 All of them.

233
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,639
 So what do you want to tell me?

234
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,639
 Well, it's just not working out.

235
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,639
 He's joking.

236
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
 But he's not working out.

237
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,639
 Oh, no.

238
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,639
 We are getting on like a big house on fire.

239
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,639
 He's getting off.

240
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,639
 No, you know what, we should leave now because you know you're a busy man.

241
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
 And we've taken a far too much of your time.

242
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,639
 Jen, can you just get the door from me there?

243
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,639
 Absolutely, Roy.

244
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,639
 So why did you come here in the first place?

245
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,639
 Um...

246
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,639
 We set up a voice activation system on your computer.

247
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,639
 I think you're going to enjoy this.

248
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,639
 It might just take a little while to get the pitch right on the voice.

249
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,639
 But nonetheless, go ahead.

250
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,639
 Thank you very much.

251
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,639
 Bye bye.

252
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,639
 Thank you.

253
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,639
 Society.

254
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,639
 Hmm.

255
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,639
 Hello.

256
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,639
 Hello, computer.

257
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,639
 Hello.

258
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:06,639
 Hello.

259
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,639
 Hello, computer.

260
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
 What good are you?

261
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
 You obviously don't know anything about computers.

262
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
 No, but okay.

263
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 But I can learn, you know.

264
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,640
 I mean, for example, Moss, you could take me through what you're doing right now.

265
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
 I'd be delighted.

266
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 I'm just working on a very simple piece of programming code.

267
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
 I see.

268
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
 Oh, God, no, I'm lying again.

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
 I didn't understand any of that.

270
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
 I don't know anything about computers.

271
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
 I mean, I'm absolutely useless to you.

272
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
 I'm also pack up and go home.

273
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
 Hi.

274
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
 Is that Roy?

275
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
 I'm around.

276
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 Hello, very little lady.

277
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
 Are you lost?

278
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 How can I help you?

279
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 I'm Roy.

280
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
 Let me go, Roy.

281
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
 Oh, Roy.

282
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
 Come here, Roy.

283
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
 I love the feel.

284
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
 Oh, my God.

285
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
 Oh, my God.

286
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
 Well, maybe there's a...

287
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 Oh, three people with a little respect.

288
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 Oh, oh, is there any touch we spoke on the floor there, dear?

289
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
 Oh, God.

290
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
 Oh, God.

291
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
 Are those noodles?

292
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
 Oh, yes.

293
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 Oh, God.

294
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
 God, what are they expensive?

295
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
 No, no, no, no.

296
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 I'm going to say, oh, God, Clevver, you.

297
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 I'm never lucky enough to get a bug in my life.

298
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 Well, I should take you, shall I?

299
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
 Yeah, no, no, no, no.

300
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
 I'm going to take you.

301
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 Oh, I'm going to call.

302
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 Why so, yeah?

303
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 Pick it.

304
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 Nice being in you.

305
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
 Chairman, wow.

306
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
 He just accused that in part of his situation.

307
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
 What situation?

308
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
 Oh, oh, that, yeah.

309
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
 Oh, my God.

310
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 Does that happen a lot?

311
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,640
 They're fairly regular the beatings, yes.

312
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 I'll save her on a bite weekly beating.

313
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
 Oh, I can not order that bad.

314
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,640
 Come on, Roy.

315
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
 It's pretty bad.

316
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
 Maybe I could help with this.

317
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
 You know, I mean, I'm a people person.

318
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
 And people like you need a person to deal with people.

319
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
 A people person like me.

320
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
 Oh, my God.

321
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 I do is a coming.

322
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
 Things are happening.

323
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
 Okay, okay.

324
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
 What would you say, yeah?

325
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,640
 If I told you that I had a plan to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.

326
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
 What would you say?

327
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
 It can't be done.

328
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 You're crazy.

329
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
 What would you say, Roy?

330
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 Roy's passed out.

331
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 Okay.

332
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
 I mean, it felt it, pen.

333
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 And some paper.

334
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,640
 Put it on my finger.

335
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
 I said, please.

336
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
 Give it up.

337
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
 No, no, no.

338
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 Don't hurt it.

339
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,320
 No, no, no, no, no, really, really, really,

340
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
 with the truth story.

341
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,600
 I'm gonna even know.

342
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
 I said, I why we don't go out with your IT guys,

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,840
 more often.

344
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,680
 You're hilarious.

345
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,480
 Yes, we are.

346
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,880
 You guys should come down him more often.

347
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 You know, you should see this.

348
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,080
 It's a new era for random industries.

349
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,759
 Can you read a bit of history?

350
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,120
 Oh, yeah.

351
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,160
 If you don't want to hear something really funny,

352
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
 a really funny story, you should hear what happened

353
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,120
 to moss and a light when we were so drunk

354
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,239
 and Amsterdam that moss lost is glasses.

355
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:36,719
 But, but, can you hear me?

356
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,559
 Tell them that story about when we were drunk and Amsterdam.

357
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,359
 Really?

358
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,079
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,839
 Oh, it's brilliant.

360
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,839
 Oh, this is a great story.

361
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,719
 You're gonna love it.

362
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:46,479
 I'm just gonna get another box of wine.

363
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,159
 We're going, man.

364
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,799
 All right.

365
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,959
 Well, one night we were really drunk.

366
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,279
 Yeah.

367
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,000
 And we were so drunk that we decided

368
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,160
 to hire prostitutes.

369
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,759
 But when they arrived at the hotel,

370
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,079
 we were too scared to do anything.

371
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,839
 So we brought them to a fair.

372
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,480
 They were really nice in the end

373
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,720
 they only charged us half,

374
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,599
 but we did have to pay for all the rides.

375
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,720
 Oh, isn't that just a best story?

376
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,200
 You told me to never tell that story to anyone.

377
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,440
 Well, when it took about a brilliant story

378
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,080
 and then you really walked into the canal,

379
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,279
 let's get out of that part with the bought man.

380
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,440
 Oh.

381
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,279
 Oh.

382
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,319
 You mean the story where I lost my glasses?

383
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
 Yes.

384
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,319
 What story did you think I meant?

385
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,319
 What?

386
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,120
 What did you say?

387
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,759
 What did you say?

388
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,959
 It's all right for you, too.

389
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,039
 He used to be in social piranhas.

390
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,199
 I'm very popular person usually.

391
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,439
 That girl earlier,

392
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:18,119
 that tried to beat me to death with her shoes.

393
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,079
 Did anybody get her number?

394
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,319
 That was a nice day at the fair, wasn't it?

395
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,159
 LAUGHTER

396
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,000
 With Brandy and Crystal.

397
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,359
 Hello, I'd say.

398
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,559
 Yeah, have you tried turning it off and on again?

399
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,559
 LAUGHTER

400
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,319
 LAUGHTER

401
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,319
 Hello!

402
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,319
 Hello!

403
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,319
 Hello!

404
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,319
 Hello!

405
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,319
